Following file only serves as a quick overview of the repository. You
can find more specific documentation about each child directory and its purpose
in additional README.adoc files, located in the corresponding directories.

If interested maybe also have a look at the documentation-only repository ->

== Structure of the Repo
image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnabauerc/LeoCodeDocs/master/protocols/images/tree.png[]

== production-system
Currently this directory is empty, because we aren't sure which method works best. When we find the best method,
the src of it will be located in this directory.

== prototypes
As explained above, right now we're not sure which method works best, but to figure out the best one I try multiple
methods, which you can see in this directory.

= Testing API

1.0, 2020-06-17

The Testing API is used to import files (tests and code) via Rest endpoints and then run
said.


== Deployment:
* At first start the Quarkus Server: `./mvnw clean compile quarkus:dev`
* Now the Endpoints are running (e.g.: http://localhost:8080/upload/code)
* To test the endpoints, you can use the simple website under http://localhost:8080

Also, you can find already created files under LeoCode/prototypes/simulating-files, to
test the api yourself.
